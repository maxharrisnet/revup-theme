        <h2>What Are Dental Implants?</h2>
        <p> An implant is a small metal screw that replaces an entire tooth. In a brief surgical procedure, the dentist inserts an implant into the bone beneath your gums right in the spot where a tooth should be. The implant acts like a natural tooth root and is finished off with a restoration such as a dental crown to help it look and feel just like a real tooth.</p>
        <p> Getting dental implants is a big deal. You think you might like an implant, but you aren’t sure what to expect. We explain everything here so that you can make an informed decision about your dental treatment.</p>

        <h2>Why You Might Need Dental Implants</h2>
        <p>Your natural teeth provide support for the height and shape of your smile, and they allow you to eat and speak comfortably.</p>
        <p>A gap in your smile could allow your other teeth to drift out of healthy functional alignment. If that happens, your risk of developing oral health problems increases. Losing just one tooth can trigger a chain of events in your mouth that negatively impact your oral health, the appearance of your face, and your overall quality of living.</p>
        <p>Even if you don't experience these effects of missing teeth, there's one problem you can't avoid: bone resorption. This is a natural process in which your body breaks down non-essential bone tissue to use the minerals elsewhere in your body.</p>
        <p>When you have teeth in your jawbone, they push against it and stimulate the production of new bone tissue. But once those teeth are gone, that bone tissue serves no useful purpose, so it slowly dissolves away. The result? A shortened jaw and chin that cause wrinkles and give your cheeks and lips a sunken appearance.</p>
        <p>Having dental implants is the second best thing to having natural teeth. You can prevent or correct the issues listed above by replacing lost teeth with implants.</p>

        <h2>The Benefits Of Dental Implants</h2>
        <p> Losing a tooth can be devastating. A missing tooth can make us feel self-conscious about our smile and may lead to a variety of health problems. Gaps can make your bite feel uncomfortable, cause difficulties eating the food you love and may lead to bone loss or shifting teeth. </p>
        <div class="section-highlight">
          <p> Restore your natural appearance Dental implants look and feel like your own teeth. They become permanent, “perfect” teeth as they are custom made to blend in with your smile. Implants look natural because they are sized, shaped and coloured to match your unique bite and natural enamel colour.</p>
          <p> Feel confident in your comfort When a dental implant is placed your jaw bone actually fuses with the titanium post as it heals. A crown or bridge can be permanently affixed to the post or the implant may be used to secure implant-supported dentures but one thing is certain: That dental implant is not moving. Laugh, smile and eat your favourite foods. Shifting teeth or sudden pain won’t even cross your mind.</p>
          <p> Improve bone strengthWhen teeth are lost, the bone that supports those teeth can begin to atrophy and weaken over time. Dental Implants stimulate new bone growth around the implant, strengthening the bone structure.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Dental implants are a long-term solution that feels natural and lasts decades with proper oral hygiene.</p>

        <h2>Why You Might Need Dental Implants</h2>
        <p>A restoration is the “false tooth” that covers the implant. The implant is not visible when you smile, but the restoration that covers it is what makes it look like you have a new tooth.</p>
        <div class="section-highlight">
          <p>Dental crown: This is the most common implant restoration, and it covers a single-tooth implant.</p>
          <p>Dental bridge: A bridge spans the gap in places where multiple teeth in a row are missing. You can replace several teeth with just one or two implants that support a dental bridge. A full implant-supported bridge is an entire arch of upper or lower teeth that are fixed to four or more implants.</p>
          <p>Implant denture: Give a removable denture more stability by clipping it onto two small implants.</p>

        <h2>How It Feels</h2>
        <p>A restoration is the “false tooth” that covers the implant. The implant is not visible when you smile, but the restoration that covers it is what makes it look like you have a new tooth.</p>
        <p>Although having a metal implant inserted into the bone of your mouth sounds painful, the procedure is far more comfortable than you might expect.</p>
        <p>We will numb your mouth with a mild anesthetic so that you don't feel any pain during the surgery. Advanced dental technology allows us to place implants quickly, accurately, and conservatively. This means less discomfort and downtime for you during recovery.</p>
        <p>Some implant patients report feeling bored and even sleepy during the brief half hour it takes to place their implant. The most uncomfortable part for you may be having to hold your mouth open for a few minutes at a time, but that's all.</p>
        <p>It is normal to experience some swelling, discomfort, and even bruising in the next several hours after the procedure. The pain is mild and very easy to manage, however. We will give you specific instructions so that you can start minimizing the discomfort before the anesthetic wears off. Your surgical implant site should start feeling better within a week.</p>
        <p>It might help you to know that dental implants have a success rate of nearly 95%. Getting an implant is one of the safest and most predictable procedures in dentistry.</p>

          <p>To make space for your veneer, a thin layer of enamel is removed from the front of your tooth. We numb the area before we start working and the amount of enamel removed is very minimal. Next, we will take an impression of your prepared tooth and it’s neighbours to make sure your veneers fit perfectly and blend in with your smile.</p>

          <h2>Cost of Invisalign in Toronto</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The out-of-pocket cost for a dental veneer can vary widely from patient to patient. With a typical insurance plan, a single veneer averages out to about $200 to $600+. Without insurance, a reasonable ball-park figure for a veneer would be about $800 to $1200 and up.</p>
        <p>So what goes into determining the cost of veneers?</p>
        <p>The number of veneers that are needed.</p>
        <p>The work that will be involved in the preparation and placement of the veneers.</p>
        <p>The type of veneers that are used.</p>
        <p>Your vision for your smile.</p>
        <p>Remember, no dental practice can provide an accurate quote over the phone. Ultimately, your needs are as unique as your smile. It’s important to speak with a dentist and undergo an oral exam to find out all your treatment options and to receive an accurate quote. If you have dental insurance, we would be happy to supply you with a quote to submit to them so you can find out your out-of-pocket costs before you make a decision.</p>
